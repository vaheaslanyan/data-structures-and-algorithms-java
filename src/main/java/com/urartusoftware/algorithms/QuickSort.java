// In-place algorithm
// Uses pivot point to compare every item in the array to that item,
// if an item is lower than the pivot item we exchange it with the first item that is greater and so on.
// Once we iterated through the array we then move the item at pivot point to the end of newly moved smaller items.
// At this point, the item that was at pivot point is no sorted and in correct spot.
// Next, we run the quick sort on the left portion and right portion (from where we moved the item that was a pivot before,
// which should now be in the middle) of the array. Once that is done we should have a sorted array.

// Space complexity O(1)
// Time complexity Î©(n log n) and O(n^2) in case of already sorted or almost sorted array. Thus, for cases like that use Insertion sort
